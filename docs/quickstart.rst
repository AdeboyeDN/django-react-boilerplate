Quickstart
==========

You can start your project with the boilerplate  following two paths: with
`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ or with plain Python (minimum 3.7.3).

Bootstrapping
-------------

This is a required process for both paths so you can have everything necessary
to start installing requirements related to the project's stack.

#. Make sure you have Django installed globally so ``django-admin`` command is
   available (version is irrelevant)
#. Open terminal and navigate to the directory you want to start your project
#. Run this command using ``django-admin``::

     django-admin startproject theprojectname --extension py,yml,json \
     --name Procfile,Dockerfile,README.md,.env.example \
     --template=https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-react-boilerplate/archive/boilerplate-release.zip

#. Now follow the **Setting up** steps below with the path of your choice.
